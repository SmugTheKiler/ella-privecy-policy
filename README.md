Hey! This is ${Ella}'s privacy policy. 

What we store:
Your ID - for database purposes and to be able to identify you from other users
| Guild ID - for custom features, and to be able to identify premium servers from non-premium
| Channels & Users - all of those stored together, meaning no one knows about your users or the guild, its for statistics 

# What if I don't want my data tracked.. ?
I mean.. you can message the developers in our support server (link is at the buttom) and ask for your data to not be tracked
This will mean tho, you will not be able to use the bot (if its your messages that you don't want to be seen).
